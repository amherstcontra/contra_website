Want to get involved? Submissions are open to anyone in the Amherst College community, from student to employee. We publish main articles, which run between 600 and 1000 words. We also try to publish responses to every main article. Responses should be between 100 and 250 words. 


Email theamherstcontra@gmail.com with your piece and tell us whether you’d like to remain anonymous. We’ll contact you with edits if we’ve chosen to publish your contribution. If you want to get involved another way, send us an email as well. We’re a student organization open to anyone.
